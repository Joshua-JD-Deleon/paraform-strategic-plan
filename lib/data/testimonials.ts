      "JD constantly leads from the front, never asking his reps to do something he hasn't already tried successfully. The main reason I joined the team as a BDR was to work and learn under JD. I was not disappointed as he pushed me to be my best in a way that was encouraging and helped me focus on my strengths while incrementally improving my weaknesses. JD wore many hats in this role including Sales Director, Enterprise Account Executive, Account Manager, Sales Enablement, and Manager. He excelled in each one. As someone who has been on multiple tech sales teams, JD truly sticks out above the rest.",
